# Rock-Paper-Scissor
A dynamic Rock-Paper-Scissors simulation where emojis bounce, collide, and evolve based on classic rules. Users input a count (2-50), and a real-time counter tracks changes. The game runs until a single type dominates or time expires, with the winner displayed in a sleek side panel.
